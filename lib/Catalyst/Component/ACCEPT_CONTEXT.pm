=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Component::ACCEPT_CONTEXT - Make the current Catalyst
request context available in Models and Views.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.02

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.02';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Models and Views don't usually have access to the request object,
since they probably don't really need it.  Sometimes, however, having
the request context available outside of Controllers makes your
application cleaner.  If that's the case, just use this module as a
base class:

    package MyApp::Model::Foobar;
    use base qw|Catalyst::Component::ACCEPT_CONTEXT Catalyst::Model|;

Then, you'll be able to get the current request object from within
your model:

    sub do_something {
        my $self = shift;
        print "The current URL is ". $self->context->req->uri->as_string;
    }

=head1 METHODS

=head2 context

Returns the current request context.

=head2 ACCEPT_CONTEXT

Catalyst calls this method to give the current context to your model.
You should never call it directly. 

See L<Catalyst::Component> for details.

=cut

sub ACCEPT_CONTEXT {
    my $self    = shift;
    my $context = shift;
    $self->{context} = $context;
    return $self->NEXT::ACCEPT_CONTEXT(@_) || $self;
}

=head2 COMPONENT

Overridden to use initial application object as context before a request.

=cut

sub COMPONENT {
    my $class = shift;
    my $app   = shift;
    my $args  = shift;
    $args->{context} = $app;
    
    return $class->NEXT::COMPONENT($app, $args, @_);
}
